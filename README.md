This was my second major project while obtaining my bachelor's at Penn State. 
Much of the project was developed with agile practices in mind. I led a team of three other students and we engaged in sprints, split up work using the MVC model.
"WallyLand" is a fragment of a overall class project where we built an application for an arbitrary amusement park. 
Each group selected functions they wanted to focus on. We did much of ours ride enhancements, so features such as checking in viewing how busy ride lines are.
